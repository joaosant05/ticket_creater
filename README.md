<p>This is one program I have developed to field the necessity in my company to one software to manage test and bug reports for softwares tests.</p>
<br>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">In this software you can find the features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create tickets;</li>
  <li>Edit or exclude existent tickets;</li>
  <li>Extract tickets to a docx file.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>To develope UI I have Used framework TKinter, anothers frameworks to create some logics on code and javascript to create one .json where storaged informations used to create the tickets. To storage the tickets and do some tests I have used mysql server local, and for production I have used google cloud sql server.</p>
<br>
<h2>In the Future</h2>
<p>In my next steps I want to make the UI more beautiful and improve some existing functions.</p>
